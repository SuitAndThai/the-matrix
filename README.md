Instructions:
A regular make creates the executable, "build."
You can run this, or you the scripts "run" or "tests".  Crack 'em open, they're pretty self-explanatory.

build can take a single flag, "test", which will run the unit tests instead of the main program.

NOTE:
If you make changes, call a 'make clean' before 'make'.
